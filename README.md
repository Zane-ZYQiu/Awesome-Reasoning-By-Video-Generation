# Awesome Visual Reasoning for Video Generation

A lightweight and curated list of papers on **video reasoning** for **video generation**, organized by reasoning capability.

> This repository is intentionally minimal.
> All papers are listed directly in this `README.md`.

## Scope

This collection focuses on recent research related to:
- reasoning over spatial structure in videos
- physical and causal understanding
- temporal forecasting and predictive dynamics
- symbolic/logical rules in video reasoning
- chain-of-visual-thought style reasoning
- zero-shot or generalist reasoning capabilities
- multimodal reasoning and world models

## Paper Entry Format

Use this format when adding new papers:

```markdown
- [Paper Title](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx) (Venue/Source Year) - One-line summary. [[code]](https://github.com/xxx) [[project]](https://xxx)
```

Keep each entry concise and factual.

## Categories

- [Spatial Reasoning](#spatial-reasoning)
